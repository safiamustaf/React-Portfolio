        Throughout my coding journey, I love to keep learning and growing.
        I'm always excited to discover new technologies and expand my knowledge.
        I have become really good at using different programming languages and tools like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.
        I've also gotten really good at solving problems and thinking critical. This helps me tackle tough challenges with confidence.
        At the moment I'm looking for new opportunities to use my skills and work with talented people.
        If you want to collaborate or have any cool projects feel free to get in touch with me.
