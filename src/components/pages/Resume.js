      <p>
        I am a current graduate student at George Mason University working towards a Master's degree in Public health with a concentration in health policy.
        The improvement of quality of life, conducting research, and collaborating with peers and patients is something that inspires me greatly.
        I have had the opportunity to conduct research and utilize data analysis at the Community Health Council as a board chair member along with volunteering at Mayo Clinic for over five years
        This has allowed me to me to gain communication skills, Interpersonal skills, time management skills, and the ability to maintain quality care throughout my career.
